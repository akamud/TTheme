# TTheme

TTheme is a YAML/JSON to PLIST/TMTHEME converter, heavily based off of [Aroma](https://github.com/jisaacks/Aroma).

# WTF?
I built this to generate [Oblivion](http://github.com/jbrooksuk/Oblivion) colour schemes much faster, allowing me to iterate current versions and generate variations with little work.
